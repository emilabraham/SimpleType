Powerups:
	Inspiration from the book The Dark Forest.
	You obtain a powerup which lets you go into strong force mode. Your ship becomes indestructible,
	but you lose access to your weapons. However, whenever you type, you now ram into your target,
	blowing it up while your ship sustains no damage. On your way to your target, you'll blow up any
	enemies along the way.
